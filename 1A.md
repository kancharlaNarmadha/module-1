# EX 1A Basic Java
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write  a Java program to get and print your name, your registration number and College.

[Name of class which have instance variable is 'Student', Name of class which have main() is 'Main']

## Algorithm
1.Start the program by creating a Student class with three data members: name, reg_no, and cge_name, all of type String.

2.Create a Main class with the main() method to execute the program.

3.Create an object of the Student class and a Scanner object to take input from the user.

4.Use the Scanner object to take input for name, registration number, and college name, and assign them to the Student object.

5.Display the collected information using System.out.println() statements.

## Program:

### Sourcecode.java:
```
import java.util.*;
class Student
{
    String name;
    String reg_no;
    String cge_name;
}
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[]args)
    {
        Student obj= new Student();
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        obj.name=sc.next();
        obj.reg_no=sc.next();
        obj.cge_name=sc.next();
        System.out.println("Your Name is: "+obj.name);
        System.out.println("Your Registration number is: "+obj.reg_no);
        System.out.println("Your College Name is: "+obj.cge_name);
    }
}
```

## Output:

## Result:
The program successfully collects and displays the student details using object-oriented programming in Java. When the user provides the name, registration number, and college name, the program stores these values in an object and prints them correctly on the screen.
