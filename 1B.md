## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program to multiply 80 to the number then divide it by 5  and subtract 15 . Display the final result.

[Class name is ‘Demo’, num=500]

## Algorithm

1.Start the program with a class named Demo and define the main() method as the entry point.

2.Declare and initialize an integer variable a with the value 500.

3.Perform an arithmetic expression ((a * 80) / 5) - 15 and store the result in an integer variable b.

4.Use System.out.println() to display the value of b.

5.Compile and run the program to observe the output of the arithmetic expression.

```
public class Demo
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 500;
        int b = ((a*80)/5)-15;
        
        System.out.println(b);
    }
}
```
